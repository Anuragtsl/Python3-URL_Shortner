# Python3-URL_Shortner

Hello Readers! So, you would have seen short URLs being used in various places (social media, websites, messaging platforms etc). 
Short URLs are easy to remember or type so they are very popular. No one loves long URLs and so the need to shorten lengthy URLs often come to us.
So, I have tried to make my own URL shortener. 

Just use your BITLY_ACCESS_TOKEN and the run the url_shortner.py and then enter the URL to be shortened and Done.
I have used Python3 for coding!

Bitly URL Shortener is very simple to use. You just need to make an account on Bitly. Then, go to Group Settings and click on Advanced settings.

Then, generate the OAuth Token. Copy the token.
